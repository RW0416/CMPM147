**Description**: This project showcases two procedurally generated “micro worlds” drawn with an 8 × 8-pixel tileset.

Ice World:A frozen plain of snow, ice floes and winding rivers. Occasional pine-like trees punctuate the vast whiteness.

Dungeon: A tiny dungeon composed of randomly-sized rooms linked by corridors. Hidden treasure chests and doors provide points of interest.

**Codes**: 

**Ice World**

"." - Snow

":" - Ice

"w" - Water

"t" - Tree

**Dungeon**

"_" - Background

"." - Rooms

"#" - Corridor

"+" - Door

"C" - Treasure chest

**Life**: Time-based animation – Every frame, the Ice World re-samples Perlin noise to tint each water tile, producing a “wind-blown” effect.
