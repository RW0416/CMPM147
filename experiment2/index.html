				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>
				<div class="image-wrapper">

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:

					Color: The sky gradient transitions from warm orange to deep purple, inspired by hues sampled from the original image. The mountain silhouettes use dark, atmospheric tones.
					
					Primitives: Clouds are rendered as ellipses and the trees are constructed with triangle primitives.
					
					Polygons: The mountains are created as single, randomly generated polygons using vertex calls, which gives each peak an organic and varied shape.
					
					Composition: Varying the random seed leads to uniquely composed scenes—with different mountain contours, cloud positions, and tree placements—ensuring a fresh landscape on each iteration.
					
					Life: Continuous animation via millis() makes the clouds drift across the sky over time, evoking the feeling of a moving scene as if viewed from a passing train, with subtle responsiveness to potential interactive inputs like horizontal mouse movements.
					</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I remembered a question in class: what is the meaning to use p5.js drawing a picture, instead of using procreate or something else? After this experiment, I found it is actually fun to draw with code. I can make the image moving, create interesting stuff only use polygons.
